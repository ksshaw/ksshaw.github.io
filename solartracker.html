        <p>I received the second highest score out of 150 people in a coursewide competition, in Engineering Design 1, to create the most efficient and energy saving solar tracker with the highest energy net gain; calculated by energy gained from the solar tracker - energy used by Arduino.  We were given two months and a limited amount of resources to make our solar trackers including 4 solar panels, 4 batteries, 1 Arduino, and Â£40 budget.</p>
        <p>The image on the left is of the prototype created using laser cut wood, two servo motors, four solar panels, four LDRs, and an Arduino.  I wrote the code for the system using C++.  The solar tracker I created is dual axis, so it takes into account not only the movement of the sun and Earth throughout the day, but also throughout the year. </p>
        <p>The tracker moves into the most optimal position by taking the inputs from the 4 LDRs separated by walls, and moves to a position where the input values are all equal, or the best position possible if it reaches the limits of the servo motors.  When the sun goes down and the receiving values are all 0, the solar tracker goes to the default position which is straight up.  I chose to go with dual axis instead of single axis, since I calculated that I would be able to achieve a greater net gain that way.  Many other people chose to make their solar tracker single axis, which restricted the energy they could gain.</p>
        <p>For my final design I decided to use acrylic instead of wood since wood would deteriorate and rot in the rainy weather in Edinburgh.  Although that increased the material cost, it was worth the durability and lifespan of the design.</p>
        <p>My design choices included optimizing the coverage and layout of the solar panels on the plate for maximum energy taken in throughout the year, ideal divider height compared to the sun pathings in Edinburgh, a parallel pair of two batteries in series to reduce energy spending while providing the necessary power for the Arduino, and writing a code which would require minimal energy exepnditure for the greatest gain possible.</p>
        <p>To ensure the Arduino did not expend unncessary energy and the energy gained was maximized against the energy expended, my code is set to run roughly every five minutes.  This is because if the code was constantly looping, the energy expended by the system would be greater than the energy it would gain.  Since this challenge took place during the winter when the daytime was very short in Edinburgh, I decided to set my looping time to be shorter than what I would have in other parts of the world closer to the equator. </p>
