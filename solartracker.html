        <p>I received the second highest score out of 150 people in a coursewide competition, in Engineering Design 1, to create the most efficient and energy saving solar tracker with the highest energy net gain; calculated by energy gained from the solar panels minus the energy used by the system (eg. Arduino, motors, resistors, etc).  We were given two months and a limited amount of resources to make our solar trackers including 4 solar panels, 4 batteries, 1 Arduino, and £40 budget.  With the £40 budget, I bought 2 servo motors, a pack of LDRs, resistors of different values, plywood, and an acrylic sheet. </p>
        <p>The image on the left is of the prototype I created using laser cut wood; for my final design, I decided to use acrylic instead of wood since wood would deteriorate and rot in the rainy weather in Edinburgh.  Although using acrylic increased the material cost, it was worth the durability and lifespan of the design.</p>
        <p>The solar tracker I created is dual axis, so it takes into account not only the movement of the sun and Earth throughout the day, but also throughout the year.  Many other people chose to make their solar tracker single axis, which limited the energy they could gain.  The Arduino controlled the two servo motors, set up in the x and y-axis and I programmed the Arduino using C++.</p>
        <p>The tracker moves into the most optimal position by taking the inputs from the 4 LDRs separated by walls, and moving to a position where the LDR resistance are all equal, or the best position possible if it has reached the limits of the servo motors.  When the sun goes down and the receiving values are all 0, the solar tracker goes to the default position which is upright.</p>
        <p>My solar panel layout made the movement calculation simpler since it was in a square shape unlike the rectangular shape that many other people had.  When the shape is a rectangle and not a square, even if the LDR readings are all the same, all the solar panels may not be receiving the same amount of sun light.</p>
        <p>Many people had the same idea of creating a LDR divider wall; however, did not do the proper calculation necessary for it to be useful.  I calculated the optimal height to form the most effective shadows when the solar tracker was not in the position it should have been in, and make sure it did not create any false shadows even when the tracker was in the correct angle.  Most people did not consider how divider height could affect their system's performance.</p>
        <p>After calculating the total amount of current and power needed by my two motors and Arduino, I decided to wire my four batteries in a 2X2 formation of series and parallel circuit.  I also considered putting the four four batteries in parallel, but it was too close to the minimum current draw I needed for my system, and I wanted some margin for error.  Putting them all in series would have drawn an excessive amount of current which was not needed for the system, and would have decreased the net gain energy in the end.</p>
        <p>To ensure the Arduino did not expend unncessary energy and the energy gained was maximized against the energy expended, my code is set to run roughly every five minutes.  This is because if the code was constantly looping, the energy expended by the system would be greater than the energy it would gain.  Since this challenge took place during the winter when the daytime was very short in Edinburgh, I decided to set my looping time to be shorter than what I would have in other parts of the world closer to the equator. </p>
        <!-- <p>From doing this project, I learned the importance of finding multiple ways of optimizing a solution.  If I had only focused on one of the optimizations I came up with, I would not have had the success I did with this challenge.  Next time I work on a project like this, I would change the code by adding a conditional statement to only fix the position of the solar tracker if the LDR values were out of a certain tolerance, instead of fixing the position ever -->ytime the loop is ran.  This would conserve energy by reducing the energy wasted on unnecessary movement by the motors.</p>
