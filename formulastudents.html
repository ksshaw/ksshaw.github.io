            <p>This is a rendered CAD of our 2020 season Formula Students vehicle.  For the first time, this year we are attempting to create an EV instead of the traditional ICE vehicles used in the competition.</p>
            <p>In the past, I designed and fabricated the insulation and electrical and fire safety features surround the driver's seat.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am working on designing the Lidar mount, tractive system container, firewall, and HVD (High Voltage Disconnect)</p>
            <p>I created a new Lidar mount, minimizing the vibration of the Lidar on the car by adjusting the position of the mount on the car, increasing the surface area, changing the shape, and adjusted the location of the antivibration pads.  Afterwards, I recalibrated the Lidar so it was adjusted to the minimized vibration using OpenCV.</p>
            <p>For the tractive system container, I improved the layout of the batteries to optimize the weight distribution and the thermal transfer within.</p>
            <p>After changing from an ICE to EV, I improved the fire and electrical safety of the driver's seat by adding additional layers of retardant and electrcial insulation to the the firewall separating the tractive system and the seat.  The tractive system container is also fully insulated and the inside is covered in sheets of fire retardant material as well.  If any electrical failure occurs, the HVD allows for quick deactivation of the vehicle.</p>
