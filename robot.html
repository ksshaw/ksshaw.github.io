            <p>As a member of Team 8 Paly Robotics for four years in high school, I was heavily involved in designing and fabricating robots which won numerous awards for their designs and performances.</p>
            <p>In 2016, we qualified for the World Championships in five years, and in 2017, we reached the semifinals.  During the four years I was on the team, we won awards such as the Creativity Award for our unique designs that differentiated ourselves from other teams, and Autonomous Awards for our reliable and efficient autonomous codes.</p>
            <p>We fabricated our robots in our own lab, and I was in charge of running machines such as CNC mills and routers, laser cutter, tig welder, and lathe.  For the robot body, aluminum was used due to its light yet durable property, and pneumatics and motors for most of our mechanism movements.</p>
